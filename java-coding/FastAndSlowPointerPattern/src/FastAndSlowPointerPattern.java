        Is Happy Number Problem
            Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is a happy number.

            We use the following process to check if a given number is a happy number:

            Starting with the given number n, replace the number with the sum of the squares of its digits.
            Repeat the process until:
            The number equals 1, which will depict that the given number n is a happy number.
            It enters a cycle, which will depict that the given number n is not a happy number.
            Return TRUE if n is a happy number, and FALSE if not.
