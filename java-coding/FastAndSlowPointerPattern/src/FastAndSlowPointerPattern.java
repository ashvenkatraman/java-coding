        Is Happy Number Problem
            Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is a happy number.

            We use the following process to check if a given number is a happy number:

            Starting with the given number n, replace the number with the sum of the squares of its digits.
            Repeat the process until:
            The number equals 1, which will depict that the given number n is a happy number.
            It enters a cycle, which will depict that the given number n is not a happy number.
            Return TRUE if n is a happy number, and FALSE if not.

        /* Problem and solution for checking if LinkedList is a cycle
        Solution summary
            To recap, the solution to this problem can be divided into the following three parts:
            Initialize both the slow and fast pointers to the head node.
            Move both pointers at different rates, i.e. the slow pointer will move one step ahead whereas the fast pointer will move two steps.
            If both pointers are equal at some point, we know that a cycle exists.
        Time complexity
            The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.
        Space complexity
            The space complexity of the algorithm above is O(1).

            Statement
                Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list. If the number of nodes in the linked list is even, there will be two middle nodes, so return the second one.
            Constraints:
                head â‰ = NULL

            Solution summary
                To recap, the solution to this problem can be divided into the following steps:
                Create two pointers, slow and fast, initially at the head of the linked list.
                While traversing the linked list, move the slow pointer one step forward and the fast pointer two steps forward.
                When the fast pointer reaches the last node or NULL, the slow pointer will point to the middle node of the linked list. Return the node that the slow pointer points to.
            Time complexity
                The time complexity of the solution above is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.
            Space complexity
                The space complexity of this solution is constant, that is, O(1).
