Re-learning how to code Java patterns and solve problems

This repository contains all the exercises found in the Educative.io course: Grokking the Coding Patterns Interview for Java (Link here: https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-coding-interview-patterns-java/).  
I take no credit for either the examples or the solutions, although I could take credit for some of the poorly written solutions that I came up with :)
